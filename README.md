# design
schoolsyst's design files, containing logos, logo animations, banners and more.

Submodule'd <sup>(soon)</sup> by nearly every `schoolsyst/*` repo, including:

- [schoolsyst/webapp](https://github.com/schoolsyst/webapp)
- [schoolsyst/desktop](https://github.com/schoolsyst/desktop)
- [schoolsyst/presentation](https://github.com/schoolsyst/presentation)

If you want to use these files in your project:

1. Contact me, I'd love to hear about why/how you use schoolsyst's visual identity :)
2. Submodule this repository, so that the files you use are up-to-date, if I ever make changes to my designs
